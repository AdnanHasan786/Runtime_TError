INTRODUCTION:
The objective and scope of the Project Library Management System is to record the details of various activities of users. It simplifies the task and reduces the paperwork. The library management will help in maintaining records and details of books, members. Librarian and Students will be allowed to login into their respective portals. Details of the records kept will be shown to the librarian who has the authority to make changes according to the needs whereas, on the students’ end, they will see all the books available in library, issue book, return book, and see all the issued books. 


PROBLEM AND SOLUTION:
The Library Management System project is to develop an application that will automate the whole procedure of a library. The software that would be developed should have facilities like Add / Delete Members, Add / Delete Books, Issue & Return. The application should be secured, as well as with limited access. The main requirement of the project will be the ease of use, besides being the most efficient and effective tool for the purpose. The application should be user friendly. An automated solution would be very beneficial to the organization. Also, an automated solution will lead to optimal utilization of the available resources, reducing duplication of effort, increasing efficiency and minimizing time-delays. Following are the main purpose of computerization:
1.	To provide services to all the students for issue, return etc. at one place.
2.	To improve co-ordination in staff.
3.	To reduce paper filling work.
4.	To reduce chances of mistakes.

RESULT:
The Library Management System was tested with a sample set of data, simulating the transactions and operations of a typical library. The system was able to successfully perform the following basic library operations:

Adding new books to the library's inventory 
• Borrowing books by students 
• Returning books by students 
• Searching for books by title or author 
• Generating a list of borrowed books 
• Generating a list of available books


In terms of performance, the system was able to handle a large number of transactions without any significant delays or errors. The system was also able to generate reports in a timely manner.
In terms of usability, the system was found to be easy to use and understand by both librarians and students. The user interface was simple and intuitive, with clear instructions and feedback provided throughout the different operations.

The system met the objectives and requirements of the project, providing a functional library management system without the need of a database  However, the system can be improved by adding more functionalities such as fine calculation, reservation, and barcode scanning integration.

Overall, the Library Management System was found to be a success in automating the process of borrowing and returning books, and providing a user-friendly interface for both librarians and patrons. The system was able to improve the efficiency and accuracy of library operations by providing basic functionalities.
